%% Problem 1
%
%The program problem1() calculates the definite integral of a
%function f over the the interval [a,b] using the composite trapezoid rule

%I tried the program on the function f(x) = x over the interval [0,1]
%with n = 2 equal subintervals and I printed out the result.

%% Problem 2
%
%The program problem2() tests the implementation of the composite
%trapezoid rule from problem one on the integral over the following 
%functions using n = 2 equal subintervals:

% a) f(x) = sinx on the interval [0,pi]
% b) f(x) = e^x on the interval [0,1]
%
%Results:
%
%After approximating the integrals of the functions f(x) = sinx on 
%the interval [0,pi] and f(x) = e^x on the interval [0,1] and 
%comparing it to the actual value I got that

%% Problem 3
%
%The program problem3() computes pi from the integral of 
%the function f(x) = c/(1+x)^2 on the interval [a,b] where c is a constant.
%
%Results:
%
%By choosing a = 0, b = 1 and c = 4 I was able to compute pi from

%% Problem 5
%
%The program problem5() computes the gaussian probability integral
%by using small and large values for the lower and upper limits and 
%using the trapezoid rule for n =100 equal subintervals. The gaussian
%interval is then computed after first making the change of variable
